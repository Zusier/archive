
**The Tweaking Community + My Findings and Discoveries**

# **Intro**

This document was written and researched by EverythingTech#1898 (or [EverythingTech](https://www.youtube.com/c/EverythingTechTutorials) on YT). This is my documentation for all of my findings and discoveries over time. I will credit the people that helped me reach my goals but they didn’t have any hand in my actual development, only gave suggestions and encouragement. Still very much appreciated.

**Optimization in a Nutshell**

# **What is Optimization?**

Let’s start with the basic fundamentals of optimization and how people get the idea of it so wrong. According to Wikipedia, “Mathematical optimization is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criterion, from some set of available alternatives”. This is typically used for mathematics but the same principles apply here. Optimization is quite simply, finding the fastest way to do something. In the case of Windows, we want to complete tasks quicker, play games at higher framerates, and have no restraints.

That in and of itself sounds fine and dandy, but the main issue is how people optimize. Most concepts that float around like BCDedit tweaks, high performance power plans, and worst of all, trying to use applications to increase the amount of available resources. Not only is that counter intuitive, it goes against optimization itself. Less steps to complete something typically means it’s faster (not always though).

# **Is Optimization Tweaking Too?**

Let’s see what Wikipedia has to say about both. Optimization means, “Mathematical optimization or mathematical programming is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criterion, from some set of available alternatives”. Tweaking means, “Tweaking refers to fine-tuning or adjusting a complex system, usually an electronic device. Tweaks are any small modifications intended to improve a system”. So, they are extremely similar, but no, not the same. This is important when mentioning these topics as people may get confused, but I doubt many even acknowledge a difference. The difference is optimization is the best selection of choices whereas tweaking is slight changes to the choices that may result in a faster output.

# **The Psychology Behind Optimization**

Now that we have established how placebo can be found, how is it possible that even with all the data and the capability to figure out if something helps or not, that people still are bound to “placebo tweaks”? Mainly due to the fact that they depend on feel. Let’s get a definition of feel and I’ll explain why that’s flawed. According to Wikipedia, “Feeling was originally used to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception. In psychology, the word is usually reserved for the conscious subjective experience of emotion”. You may ask, why is this so important? Well, tell me, if I punch you once a day everyday for a week, will it hurt the same every time? No, you may get used to it, you may get bruises or gain sensitivity to it and it may hurt more. You may never feel it, it depends on you yourself. Same applies to the “feel” approach of testing. You could feel one thing one day and another the next. It doesn’t mean your experience got worse, only your perceived experience got worse. In that case, it’s not placebo but just plain useless to try and optimize small things if you never notice it. Some may argue that even if you don’t perceive it, your muscle memory still changes and you may react faster. I would say that is a good argument, but unfortunately, that is also flawed because you may have gotten slightly less sleep or missed a meal, eaten something that upset your stomach, all things that will affect your perception and subconscious functions. 

This is why I ALWAYS recommend you test things using programs, because they don’t have these flaws, but they do have other flaws like synchronization and consistency but they are way more reliable than you are, due to the fact that PCs don’t get tired, they don’t have brains, and they operate at the same speed all the time with micro changes occurring so fast you may never see the real difference.

**Tweaking**

# **What Is a Tweak?**

According to Wikipedia, “Tweaking refers to fine-tuning or adjusting a complex system, usually an electronic device. Tweaks are any small modifications intended to improve a system”. Sounds simple enough, is what I would say if there weren't so many damn things that can be tweaked. Should everything be tweaked? No. Can everything be tweaked? Of course, but that wouldn’t be very smart.

# **Why Tweak?**

Because you have the potential to understand, observe, and make something faster (in simple terms). Why wouldn’t you try to make your system more pleasing? If you have an expensive PC or anything that is considered pre-tweaked, I still encourage you to try your hand at it. You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, make that shot today.

# **How To Tweak**

You need help with this? Oh alright, I’ll help you out. Let’s take your BIOS for example, it holds the data and configuration for all of the hardware connected to the mainboard (also known as motherboard). This configuration specifies boot types, configurations for your CPU, RAM, and more, what those components are and what they support, and finally, if they are working as intended. If we wanted to tweak the BIOS, we first need to learn what configuration controls things like CPU states, power management, timings, and more. Once that is figured out, you can now figure out what you should change. If you are tweaking, ALWAYS keep a list of the default options or create a default profile before tweaking and make sure to test the difference, explained below in the Testing category. Once you find something like C-states or RAM timings, determine if changing them makes a difference or not, if it’s dangerous, and if it can be changed. If it passes that test, research about the specific option and if there is no research on it, you could be the first to document it. After that, make sure that the tweak is within range of the actual data set, Win32PrioritySeparation is often abused when it comes to that. Then apply the change and reboot, close, or refresh the device and/or software, unless it does it automatically. Test the difference, make notes of the side effects and potential risks. If it makes a difference, then you can begin to mess around with it more until you either hit the placebo effect or notice major issues, or any at all for that matter. Once that is all complete, congrats, you just successfully tweaked that particular component, software, or whatever you tweaked.

# **Is Tweaking Useful?**

One of the greatest arguments that the community has is, is tweaking even necessary, especially on high-end components? Depends on what you are looking for and your case. If you have a weak PC that has trouble loading a web browser, then I’d say no unless you really need that extra desktop snappiness. If you have a high-end PC and have a lot of flexibility, you’d better be damn sure to make the most of your investment. I have a i7 9700K, GTX 1650 Super, and a 144Hz IPS monitor (LG Ultragear 27) but I still tweak, heavily, and that’s not because of habit. It’s genuinely helpful and further enhances my understanding of hardware and software in general. You decide whether you want to spend the time to learn, but trust me, it helps the majority of people and considering its risk free (if you are smart about it), I’d say it’s a no brainer :)

**Testing**

# **The Basis of Manual Testing**

Testing as a whole is the event in which you see if something has changed or not. According to Wikipedia, “Manual testing is the process of manually testing software for defects. The tester often follows a written test plan that leads them through a set of important test cases.” Now, why is it that when people test, they don’t account for a SINGLE variable? Either because they don’t think it makes a difference, or because they are compromising the test result so it comes out positive. There is actually a term for this, it’s a false positive, but more importantly, it’s a false positive that always reports as such. So, basically a fake test that works in favor of another person or a significant error in testing. This is common, but isn’t easy to identify. When doing tests, typically the most honest tests are the ones that share as many details as possible, rather than only the vital ones. This applies to more than just testing for PCs and such, but anything that can be tested.

# **Placebo and How To Observe It**

So, why do so many people get the concept of tweaking (and optimization for that matter) incorrect and share things they have no knowledge about? Mainly for clout and/or money. They take advantage of the fact that we are all susceptible to the placebo effect. According to Wikipedia, the placebo effect is, “A substance or treatment which is designed to have no real value. The difference between this and the result of no treatment is the placebo effect”. So, defined by this, placebo is replacing one value in place of another and experiencing no difference at all in the process.

If this is so common, why do so many people swear by these “placebo tweaks”? It’s simple, the more people that test it and say it’s good, the more people make themselves believe it works. Same thing applies to cancer treatment, that is just how powerful our mind is. The reason that this is such an issue, is because as more and more people try (and share) these “placebo tweaks”, the harder it is to find the good stuff as I like to call it.

How can you tell if something is placebo? This is simple. Just use CapframeX or xperf for testing, make sure to run it multiple times and then substitute the highest average by the lowest average. This number is your variance. If your before variance minus your highest after result equals the same or less than your before result, then the tweak is considered placebo, case closed. Some can’t be tested traditionally, like kernel tweaks or explorer tweaks, as they require specific tests that the user may not care for or even notice.

# **How To Test Properly**

This will mention similar concepts in “Placebo and How To Observe It”, but primarily for proper testing and not how to find a dud or bad test. Testing is quite simple, use the same variables everytime and keep everything as consistent as possible. For Fortnite, this means settings, driver settings, what’s enabled and what isn’t (driver wise, services wise, anything that can be disable or enabled), the Windows version (including any minor updates or patches), CPU clocks, RAM timings and speed, basically everything imaginable. If you can do that, share your test conditions and the before and after properly, congrats, you just became a master at testing. There is a little more to the story but this is as basic as it gets.

# **Advanced Testing Methodology**

Ah yes, arguably the hardest thing I had to learn was advanced testing and understanding the weight of certain variables. I’ll try to explain as best as I can, but it may be confusing. Testing is simple, account for variables, substitute them in your final result, keep it consistent and boom, you have a good test. It does get even more sophisticated than that however. More advanced testing methodologies may require you not only check before and after, but also certain time frames before and after the test was completed, multiple test scenarios (such as different Windows versions, mice, CPUs, you name it), and the checking to see if variables affect the test in a drastic way. If you learn how to not only control these variables, check them periodically, and record each and every difference, you my friend, are not just a tester, you are **the tester**.

# **How To Share Test Results**

Test results are just a collection of data that is connected to your scenario and test variables. However, I’ve seen people share tests improperly. If you want to share a test with your friends, or more importantly, with a group of people, then you’ll need to first learn basic communication skills and “debloating” of phrases. It's simple, just share the info in an organized manner, don’t add keywords and stuff (like god input or shit like that), and say that these won’t be the same as your tests, but it gives an approximate difference the person can scale up or down depending on hardware. If you can do this + test properly, then you are helping the community in great ways :)

**Lag**

# **Types of Lag**

Whew, now this is a big subject. Lag can be interpreted in many ways, but quite simply, it’s when the average operation takes slightly longer than the average. Why is this so important? Because people think lag covers things like latency, stuttering, jitters, (which by the way, these are all separate things) when it really doesn’t. In Wikipedia’s own words, “In online gaming, lag is a noticeable delay (latency) between the action of players (input) and the reaction of the server supporting the game, which has to be sent back to the client”. In short, lag is quite specific, but most people twist it.

# **How To Interpret Lag, Jittering, Stutters, and More**

So, now that we know what lag means, let’s explain the rest. We have 5 major categories: lag, stutter, jitter, latency, and input delay. Lag is mentioned above. According to Wikipedia, “Stuttering is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words, or phrases''. Used in a computer-like context, stuttering is basically a prolonged event, which is related to freezing and is typically very inconsistent. Jitter according to Wikipedia means, “In electronics and telecommunications, jitter is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably periodic signal, often in relation to a reference clock signal”. This quite simply, is a change in the normal cycle of operations, which is more controlled and lasts longer. Latency doesn’t require Wikipedia to understand properly, as it’s just the delay between a particular operation, which changes every few nanoseconds and is uncontrollable. Input lag according to Wikipedia means, “Input lag or input latency is the amount of time that passes between sending an electrical signal and the occurrence of a corresponding action”. This is also easy to explain, input lag/latency is the delay between an electrical signal (take a keyboard, mouse, or controller as examples) and the completion of the action it's assigned to. Now that we know about these major things, how do you interpret them? Well, look at the definition and see if it matches your case. If I have random stutters in my game and my GPU clocks go down for a split second, then it’s jitter (but can be stutter if it’s software related). If I have noticeable differences in a key press action, then its input lag and so on. There is microstuttering which according to Wikipedia means, “Micro stuttering is a term used in computing to describe a quality defect that manifests as irregular delays between frames rendered by the GPU(s)”. This is very similar to jitter, but the difference is, it can be caused by an unstable overclock, bad game engine, and other odd scenarios. 

# **Why Does Lag Even Exist?**

If this wasn’t obvious already, it’s due to how electronics were designed and how they manage electrical current. The main reason so many people experience it, is because a lot of software is unoptimized, which people claim to “fix”. If it’s fixed, then no one would experience it again. Some PCs have a lot of horsepower, and others, well, barely run themselves. This variance causes lag and other forms of delay and/or latency issues to exist in certain cases. Developers could do much better, but yet, they blame it all on Windows because it's the OS. Around 90% of issues come from unoptimized code on the developer side, the people who make stuff that runs on Windows, not Windows itself. Yes, Windows can be optimized, but nowhere near the degree at which Windows software can. I guarantee that if people still gave a shit about how their program runs, 80% of lag (and software latency) would be eliminated, maybe more. That’s why some programs take a while to make/update, due to the efficiency factor, re-using elements, etc.

# **How To Remove (or Reduce) Lag**

This can be complicated, but in many cases, the solution is quite obvious. First, never use a Microsoft account unless you absolutely have to. Install a fresh copy of Windows without WiFi or use a custom ISO (like [ggOS](dsc.gg/ggOS)). Never install crappy software (like Razer Cortex, Driver Booster, etc) and/or unnecessary software like Netflix, Spotify, OneDrive, etc. Most of these apps have web versions (like Discord), **use them**. Don’t run every .bat file that says “god input” on it or really anything at all unless you have tested it and it passes the placebo test, otherwise you are borderline retarded. Make sure you cleanup after yourself, especially when it comes to REG files. Software developers may leave a mess that they don’t bother cleaning up. Be intelligent about what you disable, especially when it comes to services. If you use AppX/UWP programs (things that come from the Microsoft Store typically), then why disable the AppX service? Don’t ask randos on the net to optimize your PC, not only is that very dangerous but it could compromise your data and the people on your network, which is common sense more than anything. 

After the basics, it becomes difficult to reduce lag (or jitter, stutter, etc) because Windows is damn near optimized (to feel) at that point. At this point, you want to use trusted power plans (most of which I can’t share sadly), remove DLLs related to mitigations, disable mitigations in general, try to smooth out your mouse graph, stabilize your CPU and GPU clocks (for consistency), cap your monitor’s refresh rate to multiples (ex, 144x2=288 cap and so on), and more. This alone should help you more than any basic YT guide or copier ever will.

**Synchronization**

# ` `**Why You Should Aim For It**

Sync or synchronization is quite important, especially for computers due to how they are tied to fixed clocks at any given interval. This applies to all hardware, like monitors, CPUs, GPUs, mice, and really anything as I said, even an alarm clock or a radio. The reason you should aim for it is because the closer you get to perfect synchronization, the lower a given interval will last and it won’t be disrupted over time. Sometimes things get out of sync, like with GPUs when they microstutter or with power supplies when power becomes more unstable and it not only causes significant issues related to their functions, it also adds latency to an otherwise simple task so it can correct itself. This is why it’s important you keep everything in sync, even something as simple as a mouse. One way you can do this is by keeping numbers flat (100.000 instead of 100.002) for BCLK for instance and your CPU clock (3600Mhz instead of 3598Mhz or 3602Mhz). Monitors also benefit from having these flat numbers (144 instead of 144.03) and only cap to multiples. Make sure your components are in “sync” as mentioned and your PC should feel quite responsive 99.999% of the time, unless you suffer from bad performance already lol.

# **Is It Possible?**

Sadly, perfect synchronization is impossible, but we can get very close, past human perception. This is because the universe, time, and space don’t exactly agree on being even over odd. More details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization).

**Causality**

# **Basic Concept Of Cause and Effect**

According to Wikipedia, “Cause and effect is influenced by which one event, process, state or object (a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, state or object (an effect) where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause”. Why is this even remotely important to you? Well, in terms of tweaking, one thing leads to another, and that lead often creates a trail to the root cause of an issue or solution. They are easy to identify, in fact, you already do, you just don’t know it yet. It's also related to time and space, but uh, this isn’t physiology lol.

To actually identify cause and effect, and make use of it, try to think of something you’d normally do and follow it down the chain to the root of the solution/issue. Let’s say for instance you take a bite of an apple. To bite, you had to move your jaw. To move your jaw, you had to send signals to your jaw muscles to “move” your jaw in a chewing motion. To send a brain signal, you had to think about what you wanted to do originally. Eventually, you reach the root (past wise), which is when your neurons have to communicate with other electrically charged cells to send an electrical signal to your other nerves that causes your muscles to “move”. That is the basic explanation and identification of cause and effect, and it's extremely useful when testing and tweaking.

# **Why Is This Important Specifically?**

You still aren’t satisfied? Well then, I’ll answer your question. It’s important because when testing, you may encounter false positives and/or negatives, errors, or unexpected results. You can use cause and effect to find your way to the root of the solution/issue, which is much easier than going around the lead. If used properly, it may enhance efficiency significantly and allow you to predict what may happen based on previous or other variables in a given testing scenario.

**Hardware and Software**

# **The Importance Of Good Hardware/Software**

Ah yes, many people make many mistakes when it comes to buying components or PCs in general, choosing what software is good or bad, and much more. The importance comes down to the quality of components and how good the software is that handles it, like drivers or programs like Razer Synapse. A good PSU is important because it literally handles all of your electrical components and provides power flow to the mainboard. If you have a bad PSU, OCing could be really difficult or impossible, you may experience stability issues, and worse like system freezes and PSU failure under load. Good monitors are typically TN panels around 144-240Hz, but 360Hz is making a rise with IPS panels as well. Good RAM kits typically use B-die and are clocked high/have tight timings, G. Skill provides the best kits and 32GB is good due to dual rank. There is much more but the Sources of info shown below should help you choose the rest and determine what is good.

# **Why Do People Cheap Out?**

Mainly because they either have little to spend, or they don’t think it matters. I’m here to tell you it makes a **significant** difference, way more than you’d expect. These types of people typically know what is good, but assume that it’s all good and they don’t need it. Please, if you get a desktop, spend the extra to get quality components and not hot garbage especially if you want a system that lasts for an extended period of time (8-12 years).
#
# **Do I Need High-end Components?**

Well, depends on if you want to have the best of the best, the fastest possible stuff, or just an experience that satisfies you. If you are the last scenario, then no, you don’t. Mid-end is perfect for many and oftentimes is more fun to play around with. If you like to tune a lot, get higher end stuff but stick to a mid-end CPU and GPU (high-end components). That is my opinion but as Human Interpretation (below) explains, it may be different for everyone and you may think otherwise.

**Overclocking (and how to stay safe)**

# **What is Overclocking?**

According to Wikipedia, “In computing, overclocking is the practice of increasing the clock rate of a computer to exceed that certified by the manufacturer”. So, overclocking is increasing the clocks (or decreasing timings), simple enough.

# **Why Overclock?**

Well, you like performance right? This is the best way to get extra performance, rather than spend hours tweaking Windows and your BIOS. If this doesn’t convince you, then this will. Consider that Ryzen allows you to OC on B350 on up, and memory overclocking works for all boards, for Ryzen anyways. Intel allows you to OC on K-series CPUs only and on Z-series boards only, fairly limited. You can gain anywhere from 5% all to way up to 20% more performance (in raw workloads)!

# **How To Overclock**

This is difficult to explain without visuals but I’ll try. In your BIOS, you’ll find many settings related to voltage, C-states, CPU clocks (or ratios), and more. There are [BIOS](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BIOS+tuning+guides)[ ](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BIOS+tuning+guides)[tuning](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BIOS+tuning+guides)[ ](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BIOS+tuning+guides)[guides](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BIOS+tuning+guides) that can help more than I will. Once you find these settings, make sure you know what they do before messing around with them, otherwise you are at risk of damaging your system. CPU clocks (or ratios) are interesting. For Ryzen, I believe some boards use clocks in 25Mhz intervals, others may be bound to BCLK (100.00Mhz x CPU ratio). For Intel, I know they are only bound to BCLK (100.00Mhz x CPU ratio). Memory may have XMP profiles that aren’t set by default, but also can be manually tuned by changing [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_timings)[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_timings)[timings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_timings). You can even OC your monitor using [CRU](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU) if done right by tuning the timings and refresh rate. Again, I can’t explain this very well without visuals but I hope this helps you get into the basics! There are also servers for this, like [Overclocking](https://discord.com/invite/overclock).

**Windows Versions**

# **The Main Differences Between Windows Versions**

The big difference between Windows 7 and 8/10 is AppX and the support for DX12/Ultimate (Win10 only). DWM has also been changed a ton from Windows 7/8 to Windows 10, including explorer and the overall service + user structure. Further dependence upon the Registry for storing system strings and modifiable data, used as an extender of NTFS and its file structure. Windows 7 allowed you to disable DWM for more desktop performance, Windows 8/10 does not, at least not well. Session 0 is inaccessible on Windows 10, but it can be accessed just fine on Windows 7/8.

# **Performance Differences**

Windows 10 has the best performance of any OS for gaming and productivity at the moment and Windows 7 falls behind in latency tests, mainly because it’s outdated and doesn’t have support for faster APIs. Windows 8 is extremely good however. Windows 10 1607 is the best major update I’d say. 1709 is an alternative and is used widely in the community. 20H2 is also very promising latency-wise if done right. The major differences lie in the performance mitigations and kernel/NTFS/explorer updates over time. That’s why Windows 10 is ahead of Windows 7/8 but Windows 7/8 still feels faster on the desktop, and for Windows 8, can be slightly better for gaming too, latency and input wise.

# **Is There a Real Difference Between Versions?**

Well uh, I did answer that already but yes, there is quite a difference, especially when it comes to the structure of Windows and how it handles certain tasks and errors. This can affect performance but may only be noticeable on higher-end hardware.

# **Custom ISOs (and good ones)**

Ah yes, a popular topic at the moment. Many people seem to have gotten in on the action recently and I’m here to share info on them. Custom ISOs are modified copies of Windows designed with performance in mind or to be compact. Some are also modified visually, but most are behind-the-scenes type changes. Most custom ISOs have poor quality and terrible support, but [ggOS](http://dsc.gg/ggOS) is a great example of a good project. Not only is there an active support channel, but he also responds regularly to help others fix their issues! THe OS is clean, polished, and overall has good performance with some of the newest updates integrated (typically). There is also AtlasOS, a project by [Zusier](https://github.com/Zusier) (also [Syrm](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwQ9hFaZ37LDK6PsCEVrV4g)), and [FoxOS](https://discord.com/invite/y6tYP6Z), a project on Windows 7 done by CatGamerOP. These are all amazing projects, I highly recommend you take a look at them! [RekOS](https://discord.com/invite/YNFFN4W52y) is also in the making if you want to check that out :)

There are bad ISOs however and good examples of this are VividOS, LiteOS (I think), and many other projects that are sloppy, give worse performance, or in some cases, are just plain unusable. Stay away from projects that don’t have a lot of ways to contact the owner or get help. Make sure that the project is also still actively added to over time.

**Software/Hardware Mitigations**

# **Spectre and Meltdown**
#
Ah yes, mitigations. Many people probably fear the possible consequences too much or they underestimate them, and some plain think it’ll give a bunch of performance just because. Let’s see what these mitigations actually were and why they were dangerous. According to Wikipedia, “Meltdown is a hardware vulnerability affecting Intel x86 microprocessors, IBM POWER processors, and some ARM-based microprocessors. It allows a rogue process to read all memory, even when it is not authorized to do so. Spectre is a vulnerability that affects modern microprocessors that perform branch prediction”. Now, even to me, this is quite confusing, but let’s break it down. These are security vulnerabilities (no shit), but mainly, they are memory based, meaning they can access (read/write) the memory and steal important data I believe. I’m sure there is a much better explanation for this, here is more info if you want to read it. [Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_\(security_vulnerability\)) and [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_\(security_vulnerability\)).

# **Execute Space Protection**

According to Wikipedia, “In computer security, executable-space protection marks memory regions as non-executable, such that an attempt to execute machine code in these regions will cause an exception. It makes use of hardware features such as the NX bit (no-execute bit), or in some cases software emulation of those features”. More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_space_protection).

# **Extra Mitigations**

According to Microsoft, this is all of the mitigations present for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/overview-of-threat-mitigations-in-windows-10)[ 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/overview-of-threat-mitigations-in-windows-10).

**Sources Of Info**

# **Reliable Sources**

Sources of information, especially good ones, are hard to come by. However, there are plenty of resources nowadays that will help you learn. First, good sources for finding test results. I trust [Gamer](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamersNexus)[’](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamersNexus)[s](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamersNexus)[ ](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamersNexus)[Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamersNexus), [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/user/Jayztwocents), [HardwareUnboxed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8iQa1hv7oV_Z8D35vVuSg), and [der](https://www.youtube.com/user/der8auer)[8](https://www.youtube.com/user/der8auer)[auer](https://www.youtube.com/user/der8auer). These people do wonders and have helped many choose the right components, they’ve even noted flaws with products (which got fixed), and increased the demand for higher airflow cases! [LowSpecGamer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQkd05iAYed2-LOmhjzDG6g) and [Xander](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0qqF16JIVHC45sphZRKXw)[ ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0qqF16JIVHC45sphZRKXw)[Baatz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0qqF16JIVHC45sphZRKXw) are worth a look as well. [CapframeX](https://www.capframex.com/), [xperf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install), and CinebenchRxx (15, 20, and 23 to name a few) are good testing programs and to look at temps, [HWinfo](https://www.hwinfo.com/) is good for monitoring temps and clocks for CPU and GPU, and even CPU Vcore from the mainboard.

# **Not So Reliable Sources**

Whew, there will be a lot to unpack here, but quite simply, I’ll mention bad sources and why they are bad. UserbenchMark, something I used to use a lot, is quite based on their reviews and even testing methodology. It’s a meme at this point. Tweaktubers are also worth a look, but keep in mind many are either brainlets, or are trying to help but have no idea what they are doing. I’ve seen many come and go, but the notable ones are Panjno, Basic PCTuner, Muaaz, itsJerian, and LEVITATION\_4D. It gets worse the farther down you go on the YT search results and find crap that makes no sense and doesn’t abide by the rules of optimization. Make sure to stay **far** away from YTers similar to the ones mentioned, they aren’t worth your time.

# **Why Are Good Sources Important?**

This shouldn’t even be a question you’d ask, but I’ll answer it anyway. Good sources of info help you, bad sources don’t. Bad sources share bad tips and create bad habits, yet they gain more influence than the good sources! Obscene. Always fact check what info you come across before using it.

**Tweak Sellers + Stealers**

# **Who Is a Tweak Seller?**

Well, this is simple. A tweak seller is someone who sells any type of tweak that is designed to “help” your system. The majority of these people are Whistlers (below) but some are just plain scammers. Some sell YTers tweaks, random things on the net, or even custom ISOs. Do NOT buy tweaks or anything of the sort. It is a waste of your money and you could invest it into things that are useful (like a better CPU or mainboard). These people are borderline retarded.

# **Why Are These People Hated?**

Mainly because these people don’t care about anything but clout and money (some are different, but the majority are bad). Even if they are nice like Adamx and such, tweaking is free, you are paying for free stuff because you don’t want to learn. If that was the case, I could sell this document for $30 a piece, but that would be absurd! So is selling tweaks. Again, Do NOT buy tweaks or you are a **mega brainlet**.

# **Are You a Tweak Seller If You Sell A Tweaking Program?**

Yes and no. This is quite broad so let’s break it down. If you downloaded it from the net and then included it in your paid program, then you are technically a tweak seller and/or stealer in general. If you downloaded it from the net and sold it point blank, you are a scumbag lol. If you made the program yourself (from scratch) and sold the program, then technically you are not a tweak seller but rather a provider of a service at that point. The majority fall under the latter option but there are some that may fall into the other categories.

**Humans and Stupidity**

# **Human Interpretation**

Humans, the smartest living organisms known to exist, but funny enough, we have many major flaws. I won’t get into the details but we are flawed, if this document didn’t make that any more obvious already. One flaw is interpretation. Why is this an issue? Think about it, we share info everyday, but we have our own interpretation of that info. You may read this and be confused, you may already know all this, or you may be a brainlet looking for free tweaks (lol). Either way, you have your own interpretation and that is based off of what we know, which only makes matters worse. If we all knew everything, our opinions would be near the same, but that wouldn’t be any fun (or pain). If there is one takeaway from this particular topic, it’s that we aren’t created equal, and we should treat others like it is, nor make ourselves believe we are all the same, mentally anyways.

# **Stupidity and Why It Sucks**

I deal with this too often, but I would be disrespectful if called someone stupid (or a brainlet). I’ll keep this simple, stupidity according to Wikipedia means, “Stupidity is a lack of intelligence, understanding, reason, or wit”. I don’t use this in any other way than to further emphasize how stupid and intellegent the human race can be. You can fix stupidity, but you can’t fix mental blindness or denial.

# **How To Be Smart**

First of all, if you skip over ANY part of this document or just ignore parts of it, you aren’t helping yourself. You want to be smart? Research, think, and most importantly, ask. The smartest people had to learn, no other route can be taken. Shortcuts are for stupid, lazy, ignorant people, and there is a difference between a fast method and a shortcut. A fast method is a shorter, more compact list of instructions whereas a shortcut skips part of the list of instructions. Research is as easy as 1, 2, 3, Google and thinking is uh, self explanatory. Just make sure the knowledge sticks, take it slow at first, and then build yourself up when you are well-grounded in basic knowledge.

**The Main Issue**

# **Big Problem**

Now that we have established major issues, a lot of solutions, and even ways to learn, why doesn’t everyone know about this stuff already? Quite simply, people believe what they want to believe. They could be wrong, but they won’t notice their wrong in front of their doubt and denial. This is why the community is such a pain in the ass to deal with. The common term for those types of people is a brainlet, but I don't encourage the use of names. Give them a chance, send them this very document you are reading right now, anything but make fun of them, as they will only deny the truth longer.

# **The Whistlers**

The Whistlers are a very interesting group, due to how they don’t seem to acknowledge simple concepts or ignore learning entirely. The whistlers seem to ask lots of questions, and I mean **lots**. They don’t seem to want to learn in any way, but instead are interested in a shortcut so they can take the easy way out. I’ll also combine the beggars into this group. 

The whistlers are the main reason why most people stopped helping each other. They were tired of the blatant ignorance and lack of intelligence, but I’m here to tell you they need you, you need to push as hard as you can to make sure they learn. Why should you? Well, it will make the community a lot less toxic and potentially enjoyable. That’s all I’ve got to say for that group, I typically try to avoid it.

# **Sharing Info and How It Corrupts**

Lastly, well-known tweakers like Tom, Danske, Fanta, and Amit to name a few, are what make up most of the opinions of the aforementioned groups. This is particularly bad because info is destined to be mixed up and twisted. It’s not the tweakers fault in any way, but I feel I must mention it so that everyone is aware, they do provide good knowledge and/or resources, but it just gets twisted over time.

**Outro**

After everything I mentioned, why do I still want to be here, or anyone for that matter? For the same reason I’m writing this document, because I want to inform others, no matter the cost. I want people to get the right info, even if the majority of what people share is wrong, and I want people to learn. That is my goal, and my hope is that the rest of the community can do the same.

If you read this whole thing, thank you, it means the world to me. I’ll be adding more to this over time once I get the time to, but for now, I hope this gives you insight to what all of us tweakers deal with and how it affects you.
