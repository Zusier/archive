It may appear to the normal user as if it is either on or off, but there are many different classes of power states that are used to lower the power used when there are minimal need for it to be at full power.

## P-States
P-States, also known as Power Performance States scale the current frequency and voltage. The number of available P-States depends on the processor.

## C-States
C-States lower power usage by powering down subsystems
